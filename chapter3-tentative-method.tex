\chapter{Tentative Methodology}\label{ch3}
In order to create a graph $G = <V,E>$, where set of vertices is $V = <v_1,v_2,... v_n>$ and
set of edges $E = <e_1, e_2,...,e_m>$. Here vertex $v_i = <m_i, c_i>$ where $m_i$ is a tweet and $c_i$
is a concept from dbpedia.
So each node is a pair of tweeter mention $m_i$ and its corresponding concept $c_i$.

To create the nodes, we need to collect tweets. But the tweets donot give adequate data. 
Since a single tweet doesnot give us adequate data, we can use a set of tweets discuss about same topic 
leading us to some data to disambiguate meaning. In order to work with tweets, we need to 
perform some Natural Language Processing. For this we will use GATE Developer ~\cite{url0gate} , a 
text analysis or language processing toolkit.

Next we need to collect data from dbpedia. Next we will create $n$-grams of the collected data and tweets,
 and use machine learning to train to match tweets with its corresponding concept.

 Thus we will have nodes $<m_i, c_i>$. After that, we need to connect the nodes with edges. 
 We will use link detection tecniques as discussed in ~\cite{ref3LinkWikipedia} to 
 find possible links and disambiguate links.
