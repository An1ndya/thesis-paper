\chapter{Tentative Methodology}\label{ch3}
In order to create a graph $G = <V,E>$, where set of vertices $V = <v_1,v_2,... v_n>$, $v_i = <m_i, c_i>$ and
set of edges $E = <e_1, e_2,...,e_m>$.
Here, each node is a tweeter mention $m_i$ and its corresponding concept $c_i$ pair.
 we need to create nodes and edges.
To create the nodes, we need to collect tweets. But the tweets donot give adequate data and so, 
we need to collect data from dbpedia. Next we willl create $n$-grams of the collected data and tweets,
 and use machine learning to train to match tweets with its corresponding concept.

 Thus we will have nodes $<m_i, c_i>$. After that, we need to connect the nodes with edges. 
 We will use link detection tecniques as discussed in ~\cite{ref3LinkWikipedia} to 
 find possible links and disambiguate links.
