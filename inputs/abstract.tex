In this paper, we wish to work on creating a Knowledge Graph using Twitter micro-data.
A Knowledge Graph is a representation of human knowledge in the form of a graph. Just like any graph, 
it has nodes (entities), attributes and edges (relations). Since tweets give us limited data 
(maximum length of 300 characters), it becomes very difficult to extract adequate information to create 
a knowledge graph.
