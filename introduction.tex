\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}

The present world is a place with immeasurable date or informations due to world wide web.
 Each and every day this amount is increasing. It is getting harder day by day for people to extract 
 exact information he/she needs and to analysis them to have a desired goal. However this big data 
 has become a challenge for computer science to organize, 
 store and most importantly efficient searching. (As far as the word  efficient searching means 
 searching a particular word with all its variationns.) 

A single word can represent a person, place, name of organization, restaurant . Again a word slightly different 
spelling can represent totally different thing. It is very hard for a single person or a particular 
softwere to do this. So, we need to make machine learn way of efficient searching.

It may be helpful for us to write grammers for machine to learn than writing all 
the rules of searching by ourselves.
Now for machine to learn to work or search in order to search efficiently we need 
data or information to be organized in a way that machine can analyze those data.
Here knowledge graph comes into play.
